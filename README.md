# Amazon-Product-Review-Analysis

With the leading usage of text mining and text analysis, we
have performed few machine learning algorithms and models
on the data set. This data set contains reviews of a product
both in the form of ratings (number of stars given out of 5) and
text comments. Instead of predicting the rating, this analysis
tries to find an accurate solution to the below question:
1) Can we predict the review type, positive, negative, or
neutral review, based on text reviews from the customers?
